Description: Contains functions to conduct prediction of future mortality rates and survival probabilities by using Bayesian methods. The predictions are obtained by utilizing two models: the dynamic extension of the Heligman-Pollard model and a Gaussian Markov random field model. The package also contains functions to conduct Bayesian inference for the parameters and latent states of the models. See in Alexopoulos et al. (2019) <10.1111/rssa.12422> for methodological details.
